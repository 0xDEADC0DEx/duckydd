# Ducky Detector Daemon
This daemon protect aims at detecting and protecting against any rubberducky attacks.

Currently tested against: Maldruino elite / Bash Bunny

![CMake](https://github.com/0xDEADC0DEx/duckydd/workflows/CMake/badge.svg?branch=master)
![CodeQL](https://github.com/0xDEADC0DEx/duckydd/workflows/CodeQL/badge.svg?branch=master)

## Compatibility Note:
This daemon depends on the following libraries:
```
udev
libc
```

The following libraries can optionaly be linked against to provide
the daemon with keymaps from the x server.
```
xkbcommon
xkbcommon-x11
xcb
```

Systemd is not required although you will have to write your own init script
if you don't want to use the provided service file.

## Install:
```
# Clone the code and the submodule
$ git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/0xDEADC0DEx/duckydd
$ cd duckydd

# Compile the code in the build directory
# (You can optionaly change the -DENABLE_XKB_EXTENSION flag to OFF if you don't want to link against x server dependent libraries)
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DENABLE_XKB_EXTENSION=ON && cmake --build build
```

If you use Systemd then you can install the project with a service file like this:

```
cd build
sudo make install
```

## Arguments:
```
Usage: duckydd [Options]
		-c <file>	Specify a config file path
		-d		    Daemonize the process
		-v		    Increase verbosity of the console output (The maximum verbosity is 2)
		-h		    Shows this help section
```

__Important Note:__
THE -v OPTION IS FOR DEBUGGING!
DISABLE IT IF YOU DON'T NEED IT BECAUSE IT COULD POTENTIALY LOG AND THEIRFORE EXPOSE PASSWORDS!

## Config entries:
If you installed the project with the command above then the config file should be located under /etc/duckydd/duckydd.conf.

The file format is as follows:
\<parameter> \<option>


`minavrg 0s 7327733ns`

Sets the minimum average difference time between keystrokes. If the minium average of the
currently typed string is smaller than the set value then the score will be incremented.


`maxscore 0`

The so-called "score" of an event file is an internal variable which depicts
how dangerous the HID device is. If the daemon increments the score over the set maxscore
and a key is pressed then it will grab the file descriptor that was opened
and thereby block any further keystrokes from being received by any other program
that was listening for events.

At the moment it is incremented if a device:
with the same major and minor id registers as a input device and a virtual com port.
types faster than the allowed maximum average.

After the keyboard has been locked you have to replug it
to unlock it.


`logpath /`

Sets the path where every log file is saved in.

If the process is passed the -d flag (daemonize) then it will also write
its log messages to a file which is called out.log in the logpath directory.

Otherwise it will just use the directory for the keylog file which is called key.log.

__Note:__ You have to set a full path because the daemon has
to be started as root. Currently the parser does not expand the string
using environment variables.


`usexkeymaps 1`

If this option is enabled the daemon will first try to initalize the x dependent keymap.
If the use of the x keymap fails then the daemon falls back to kernel keymaps.
At the moment the use of the kernel keymaps is **experimental** although alphanumberic characters
of the english language work.

## Uninstall:
Run the following commands from the project root to get rid of duckydd
```
$ cd build
$ sudo xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
$ sudo rm -rf /etc/duckydd
```

## Known issues:
### No protocol specified
If you get the message "No protocol specified" when starting the daemon as a service
then you need to add the user root to the list of trusted users of the x server.
This needs to be done so that the daemon can access the master keyboard.

You can test if this is the case by issuing the following command and then restarting the daemon.
`xhost local:root`

If the error disappears then you need to make the .AUTHORITY (which is usually in your home directory)
file containing the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE readable to the root user.

You then need to export the XAUTHORITY environment variable like this before the daemon starts.
`export XAUTHORITY=/home/<username>/.Xauthority`

If you use systemd you can add the following line to the duckydd service file in the "[Service]" section.
```
[Service]
Environment="XAUTHORITY=/home/<username>/.Xauthority"
```
